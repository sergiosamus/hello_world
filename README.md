Test repository to learn how to use GitHub


This is to fix the previous pull request and make an update on an actual branch rather than on the master.
Sat down in a coffee on a Thursday evening, drinking coffee.
Place is almost empty with the exception of some couples discussing random topics.
Cheers.
